# 🛠️ Job Scheduler Microservice

A production-ready job scheduler microservice built with **FastAPI**, allowing users to create, list, and manage scheduled jobs via REST API. Jobs are scheduled using flexible **cron expressions** and executed by a background scheduler.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Create Jobs** with custom name, description, and schedule
- ✅ **Cron-based Scheduling** using APScheduler
- ✅ **List All Jobs**
- ✅ **Get Job by ID**
- ✅ **Database-backed** (SQLite)
- ✅ **Swagger API Docs** (FastAPI auto-docs)
- ✅ **Modular code** following SOLID principles
- ✅ Designed for **Scalability & Performance**

## 🌍 Scaling Strategy (For Brownie Points 🌟)

To scale this microservice across ~10,000 users, ~1,000 services, and ~6,000 API requests/minute, we recommend:

### ✅ Horizontal Scalability
- Containerize with Docker and deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer (e.g., Kubernetes + NGINX or AWS ALB)
- Use Redis or a distributed store to coordinate scheduled jobs across instances (e.g., APScheduler + RedisJobStore)

### ✅ Background Processing
- Offload job execution to background workers (e.g., Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ)
- Use task queues to handle job spikes and retries gracefully

### ✅ Database & Performance
- Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production
- Use indexes on job.id and next_run for efficient querying
- Add async support with `databases` or `async SQLAlchemy` for high I/O workloads
